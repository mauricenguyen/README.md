# üåê Welcome to My Github! 
##### Hello! My name is Maurice Nguyen and I am currently a computer science student at UNCC. I have some experience working on front end software development during my time as an intern at Ally. I started programming when I got into college and although I started with no prior knowledge of what coding was, I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience here at UNCC. I love working on front end development as being able to visual the chnages I make!

# üêá About me: 
- **Education**: UNCC Computer Science BS
- **Previous Experiences**: Intern at Ally Financial
- **Languages**: Java, C/C++, Python, 
- **Hobbies**: Video games and listening to music

# üíª Projects: 

**Project 1: Ally AAOS Website**
 - **Description**:  Revamped the Ally Customer Service Report console using React.js, Metronome, and Typescript, completed using the Agile methodology while working with my fellow intern team in a full stack team.

**Project 2: Sandwich Ordering App**
- **Description**:  In my software engineering class at UNCC, my group decided to develop an app that would keep track of sandwich orders, promotions, payments, and inventory. Users were able to keep track of their orders and create an account to also write a review on the sandwich they ordered. This was done using Python.

# üí´ Goals and Objectives: 
Some key goals of mine are to finally graduate as this is my final semester and to start applying for different companies. I would like to be on a front end team and learn more about machine learning as well. As for this class, I hope to learn alot more of how to work in a SDLC framework and to be able to create my own project!
